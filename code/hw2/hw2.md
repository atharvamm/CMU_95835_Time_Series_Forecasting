# Project: Back test ETS and ARIMA time series models

For this assignment, my task was to address the problem of predicting and backtesting monthly sales of anti-diabetic drugs in Australia using the provided class data. The assignment involved conducting backtests for 12-month forecasts over four distinct test periods: July 2004 to June 2005, July 2005 to June 2006, July 2006 to June 2007, and July 2007 to June 2008.

To accomplish this, I implemented multiple ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonal) and ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models, systematically evaluating their performance over the designated backtest periods. The objective was to create an efficient plot that visually represented how each model performed against the actual data points during the backtest periods.

After conducting the backtesting, the assignment required me to make a decision based on the results and identify the ONE model that I would recommend for predicting the next 12 months. In my analysis, I suggested the Triple Exponential Smoothing (ETS) model as the preferred choice, substantiating the selection with reasons derived from the backtesting results.
