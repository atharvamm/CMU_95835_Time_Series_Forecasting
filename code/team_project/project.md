# Empowering Prosumers: A Predictive Time Series Analysis of Electricity Prices, Consumption, and Savings

During this project, I delved into extensive data on electricity prices, consumption, and production across various houses in different counties in Estonia. Leveraging a dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-energy-behavior-of-prosumers/data), my aim was to forecast electricity prices, consumption, and production at the county level, with the goal of providing an average estimate for strategic planning and decision-making.

## Data Utilization

The dataset provided comprehensive information on electricity-related metrics, enabling me to employ sophisticated forecasting models. I harnessed the power of ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonality), ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average),[LTSF - Linear/DLinear/NLinear](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13504.pdf) Models, [Random Forest Regressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html), [XGBoost Regressor](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [FB Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html#python-api), to gain insights into the future trends of electricity prices, consumption, and production.

## Motivating Prosumer Behavior

A key aspect of my project was calculating the potential cost savings for prosumers â€“ individuals or entities that both produce and consume electricity. By showcasing the economic benefits of prosumer behavior, I aimed to motivate more people to participate in this energy-efficient model.

## Results and Impact

My forecasts not only provided valuable insights into the future trends of electricity-related metrics but also demonstrated the potential financial advantages of embracing prosumer status. The calculated cost savings served as a compelling incentive for individuals and entities to consider becoming prosumers, contributing to a more sustainable and economically efficient energy landscape.

In conclusion, this project combined data science methodologies with a focus on real-world implications, emphasizing the role of prosumers in shaping the future of electricity consumption and production.
